- Generalize Doddi's state machine so it can become a plugin for GP2D. Maybe as a different namespace. (DARKGuy)
- Make the function to load non-power-of-two textures as discussed on the forum (http://iteam.freeforums.org). (DARKGuy)
- Add lots of warnings, checks and return values for most of GP2D's functions. They could be really useful for debugging. (DARKGuy)
- Make PrintDebug more flexible... to do something like printf(), accept parameters such as %s, %i, and such, like printf(). (DARKGuy)
