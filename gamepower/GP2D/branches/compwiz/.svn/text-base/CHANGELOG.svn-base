- Fixed 64-bit makefile thanks to Compwiz. (DARKGuy)

20 Jul 07
- Added Doddi's Freetype changes for loading 256 characters instead of 128. (DARKGuy)
- Added new sprite functions by Doddi. (DARKGuy)
- Added a basic sound system, changed the way musics are played. They must now be a class just like any sprite. Check audio.cpp/h for more info. (DARKGuy)

- Unified the makefiles into one. (DARKGuy)

- Forgot to add all of the changes so I'm gonna list the most important ones... (DARKGuy)
  - Implemented a Timer class (taken from doddi's gameTimer one, just renamed and integrated into the code) (DARKGuy)
  - Integrated doddi's sprite and spritesheet code (DARKGuy)
  - Added a small hack to fix the pix variable in sprite.cpp temporarly so the code would compile (pointer to the sprite texture's SDL_Surface)... it needs to sync with the current spritesheet's image. (DARKGuy)
  - Fixed a collision bug, IIRC. (DARKGuy)
  - Removed the binary files. You'll have to compile the library then copy the file to your game's root folder now. (DARKGuy)

- First changelog file... huh, I should've added one long time ago... well, here it is. (DARKGuy)
- Removed a line in the collision detection routine... &pa wasn't being used, and it caused errors when compiling on Windows. It has no effect removing it anyways, so it's ok. (DARKGuy)
- Removed the normal makefile, and created a few ones, for different architectures (thanks compwiz18 for the testing on Arch in 64-bit). Compiling should be done now with "make -f Makefile.TYPE"... where type is the type of binary you want to create... Linux32 is for Linux, 32-bit. Linux64 is for Linux, 64-bit... win32 is for Windows 32-bit, and so on. (DARKGuy)
- Added some defines for detecting the platform and including some Windows header files in gp2d.h (DARKGuy)
