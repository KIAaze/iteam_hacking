-Created a new Makefile similar to the one used for iteam. It is in the lib directory, but is called through the Makefile in the parent directory. No more useless recompiling that way. :)
-Added a console_test.cpp program on which I am currently testing text input. I'm planning on implementing terminal widgets in GP2D.

-New function:
int SetDataDir(const char DataDir[]); -> so you can choose where the data folder is located. (was necessary to create a working debian package).
The data directory will be stored as DATA_DIR which is declared in core.cpp and as extern in gp2d.h.
-Modified functions:
All loading functions so that when you put in "data/char/susi.png" for example, they will use "DATA_DIR/data/char/susi.png". DATA_DIR is set through SetDataDir.

-Added a program to test Jorgerosa's animations.
-Copy all animations from jorgerosa's folder on the FTP into data for it to work.
-Press TAB to switch between animations.
=>Discovered bug: animations whose dimensions aren't a power of 2 are not displayed correctly (white rectangle).
This means that animation .png images should contain 2^x images in width and height.

- Added new functions in core.cpp/.h for key actions on key down and key up, for mouse interaction and windows minimized detection (KIAaze)
- Changed CatchEvents() so that it returns the value of SDL_PollEvent(&Event) (KIAaze)

- Fixed 64-bit makefile thanks to Compwiz. (DARKGuy)

20 Jul 07
- Added Doddi's Freetype changes for loading 256 characters instead of 128. (DARKGuy)
- Added new sprite functions by Doddi. (DARKGuy)
- Added a basic sound system, changed the way musics are played. They must now be a class just like any sprite. Check audio.cpp/h for more info. (DARKGuy)

15 Jul 07
- Unified the makefiles into one. (DARKGuy)
- Merged doddi's code modifications for the engine into GP2D, oficially. (DARKGuy)

- Forgot to add all of the changes so I'm gonna list the most important ones... (DARKGuy)
  - Implemented a Timer class (taken from doddi's gameTimer one, just renamed and integrated into the code) (DARKGuy)
  - Integrated doddi's sprite and spritesheet code (DARKGuy)
  - Added a small hack to fix the pix variable in sprite.cpp temporarly so the code would compile (pointer to the sprite texture's SDL_Surface)... it needs to sync with the current spritesheet's image. (DARKGuy)
  - Fixed a collision bug, IIRC. (DARKGuy)
  - Removed the binary files. You'll have to compile the library then copy the file to your game's root folder now. (DARKGuy)

- First changelog file... huh, I should've added one long time ago... well, here it is. (DARKGuy)
- Removed a line in the collision detection routine... &pa wasn't being used, and it caused errors when compiling on Windows. It has no effect removing it anyways, so it's ok. (DARKGuy)
- Removed the normal makefile, and created a few ones, for different architectures (thanks compwiz18 for the testing on Arch in 64-bit). Compiling should be done now with "make -f Makefile.TYPE"... where type is the type of binary you want to create... Linux32 is for Linux, 32-bit. Linux64 is for Linux, 64-bit... win32 is for Windows 32-bit, and so on. (DARKGuy)
- Added some defines for detecting the platform and including some Windows header files in gp2d.h (DARKGuy)
