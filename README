If you wish to contribute, please respect the following rules:
-keep all data in the data folder
-do not duplicate/copy folders to create your "branch", use git branch instead
-please communicate what you are doing to avoid work duplication/branch multiplication
-never put tabs after the beginning of a line! (tabs for indentation only, spaces for alignement or indentation (tabs vs spaces to be decided))

TODO: Decide on code conventions:
-tabs vs spaces
-variable naming (m_,l_,g_,lower/upper/camelCase,underscore,etc)
-create astyle template if possible
