-renewed Iteam-merge with a modified trunk

=======================================

18 November 07 (by Goens)
-Improved ImageButton:
it now uses the path, filename and number of files
to load the images
instead of having to explicitly load each image

-Text input in trunk (for future chat & console) is now working as it was in my branch before. (KIAaze)
-If you want to try parsing input text or sending it over the network:
	There are 4 messages stored in 2 buffers:
		char iteam::message[256]; -> contains the currently typed message
		char iteam::message_buffer[3][256]; -> contains message history
	
	There is also a global variable "talk" which defines if we are currently in talk mode or not:
		*talk mode: all keys unregistered except talk key ("return" by default)
		*non-talk mode: standard game keys
	
	This should make things clear:
		Text(iteam::Font[1], 10,64+17*16, 0,1,1,1, 1,1,1, "%s",message_buffer[0]);
		Text(iteam::Font[1], 10,64+18*16, 0,1,1,1, 1,1,1, "%s",message_buffer[1]);
		Text(iteam::Font[1], 10,64+19*16, 0,1,1,1, 1,1,1, "%s",message_buffer[2]);
		if(talk) Text(iteam::Font[1], 10,64+20*16, 0,1,1,1, 1,1,1, "Talk:%s",message);
-added symlink to libgp2d.so to trunk

16 November 07
- Merged my branch into trunk. (KIAaze)
- Basic "Tanks" and "talk mode" now work in trunk. (more work is required for those two)
- Event callbacks are now used by default. Remove "-DUSE_EVENTCALLBACK" in the Makefile if you want to use the old system again. (it will only change the way the left/right keys work in players.cpp)
- Functions created:
	*void RegisterIngameKeys();
	*void UnRegisterGlobalKeys();
	*void UnRegisterIngameKeys();
	*void ShowChar(SDLKey key, Uint16 unicode)
- TODO list merged and now contains a link to the TODO on wikispaces.com
- package subdirectory added to create debian packages. A script to create them from the svn might be added later.

Planned very soon: ^^
- Documentation updated
- Pause and music key working
- Weapon switching working

27 August 07
- Changed Makefile to add SDL_gfx. (DARKGuy)

23 August 07
- Added 4-5 new sound files for playing when the turn counter ticks. (DARKGuy)
- Modified the code accordingly to the new GP2D sound system. Music and Sound now work. (DARKGuy)
- Fixed the countdown timer. It now swaps the turn between players 1 and 2. (DARKGuy)
- Gave a special effect to the "Start!" text after the beginning of the match. (DARKGuy)

22 August 07
- Added Jorge's new countdown images. (DARKGuy)
- Added a timer on the top-right corner of the screen. (DARKGuy)
- Changed the default egypt level for a great, 3D grassy one by Jorge :). (DARKGuy)
- Adapted the code to the recent changes on GP2D. (DARKGuy)

20 August 07
- Changed the way resources are loaded. They're vectors instead of variables, which makes loading stuff much easier so we don't have Layer1, Layer2, Layer3 but just an array (ex. Layer[0-3]). It applies to sprites, sounds, fonts, timers and players. (DARKGuy)
- Added some sounds and changed path of jump.wav to data/sound/characters/jump.wav. (DARKGuy)
- Minor change to mainmenu.cpp. (DARKGuy)

18 August 07
- Added mainmenu.cpp/mainmenu.h. (DARKGuy)
- Simplified the header loading by including them all in globals.h. Now you'll only have to include globals.h and you'll have all the headers included. (DARKGuy)
- Changed the FPS back to 60. (DARKGuy)
- Created an Intro and basic Main Menu routines. (DARKGuy)
- Added data/gui/intro.png and /data/gui/menu.png. (DARKGuy)
- Simplified the Makefile. (DARKGuy)
- Removed the "Ticks are:" in weapons.cpp so it doesn't slow down when throwing a bomb and users come for testing the trunk. Weapons are almost ready anyways so no need for that old code. (DARKGuy)
- Removed the "debinous" level since it's no longer used. (DARKGuy)

20 Jul 07
- Merged mix of Mike and Doddi's weapon system and iteam enhancements flawlessly. Great job guys!. Players can now shoot bouncing bombs which don't explode... -yet- ;). (DARKGuy).
- Changed the way we load the song and play it according to the new GP2D modifications made. (DARKGuy)
- Added a "boing!" sound when jumping.

15 Jul 07
- Added -fPIC to the new Makefile (thanks Judo). (DARKGuy)
- Removed the makefiles and unified them into one, they also must have the include path of GP2D, according to Doddi's makefiles so iteam uses those instead of having a local copy on /library_h. The local copy is still needed though. (DARKGuy)
- Modified TODO. (DARKGuy)

28 Jun 07
- Forgot to add all of the changes so I'm gonna list the most important ones... (DARKGuy)
  - Adapted the code to use GP2D's new sprite/spritesheet implemented class by doddi. (DARKGuy)
  - The countdown timer is broken now, it has to be fixed because it now shows only the first sprite ("3"). (DARKGuy)
  - Removed the binary files. You'll have to compile the game before running it now. (DARKGuy)

23 Jun 07
- First changelog file... huh, I should've added one long time ago... well, here it is. (DARKGuy)
- Removed a few files that aren't gonna be used anymore (Iceworld folder, libgp2d.so in Library_h, mage.png from the characters and Song8.mp3 from the music). (DARKGuy)
