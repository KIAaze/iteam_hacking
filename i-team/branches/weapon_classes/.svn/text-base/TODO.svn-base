-update TODO on wiki and empty this one
-decide if physics variables should be in Sprite or in Players/Weapons and then make sure it's only in one place to avoid confusion
(That's because Mickey's physics engine uses vx,vy,&co from Sprite class instead of players/weapons classes)
OR create a new class system:ex:
|--sprite
|  |--gui
|  |--background
|  |--level
|  |--physobj
|  |  |--player
|  |  |--weapon

-create 3 functions:
1)physics processing
2)update (health, inventory, power, etc)
3)render
Then make a big loop:
for objects do {
if(physical) object.processphysics();
if(active) object.update();
if(visible) object.render();
}
Another less efficient solution (but closer to the current code) would be:
main(){
processphysics();
update();
render();
}
where each function loops through objects

=======================================================
-Finish debugging GP2D. Once it works in Iteam-merge, replace trunks in gamepower and i-team.
-Last display bug seems to have to do with the button classes.
-Make it so that textures are independant from sprites, i.e.: don't reload textures everytime a similar sprite is 
created. Use pointers for sprite/spritesheet textures.

================merged in from my TODO (KIAaze)========
• debian package with dh-make
• implement use of autoconf (configure, make, make install)
• text input: console (dropdown from top) + chat (Warcraft 3 like)
• improve physics engine: make friction and horizontal inertia work
• freetype Text centering
• remove memory leak in trunk!
• music playlist&switching
• vehicle class
• AI
• credits
• XML parsing (shouldn't be too hard to do with libxml)
• pak files
• gettext
• heat-seeking missile
• guided-missile
• target-lock missile
• guns! : pistol, machine gun, shotgun, laser (cf Metal Blob Solid (free/libre content&code :D ))
• other grenades?
• investigate possibilities of bot and mod creation (python? LUA scripting?)
• Prepare command-line parsing: at launch as well as for the ingame terminal (I was thinking of counter-strike like commands)
• Make choose character/vehicle and team-organization menus

=======================================================

=================Original TODO list from trunk=========

30th Oct 2007

- more characters
- a chat feature
- network game connectivity
- a single player mode
- a configuration page in the main menu for screen size and sound etc


15 Jul 2007
- Remove library_h and make iteam use an user-specified folder for the GP2D header files, which should be defined in the Makefile, if possible. (DARKGuy)
