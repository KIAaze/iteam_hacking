BUGS:
=====
-Sometimes when jumping close to a "wall", you can climb the wall (lift effect). (could be fun to leave in the game as bug to exploit ^^ ) => seems to come from the fact that player is moved up in case of collision
ex: jump at the left of the column in egypt
-Sometimes you can jump through a "ceiling". => seems to come from the fact that player is moved up in case of collision
ex: jump from underneath a palmtree in egypt
-When throwing the bombs, sometimes, there's no gravity and the bomb goes away in a straight line.
-terrain destruction bug? cf destruction_bug.jpg on the ftp
-It's possible to cause a segmentation fault when playing with dynamite and lots of Susis. Exact cause still unknown.
