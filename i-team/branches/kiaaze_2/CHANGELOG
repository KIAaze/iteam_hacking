-Working "merge" finished, but it's ugly and not really merged yet in some places.
-Needs to be cleaned up and clarified.
-For left/right movement, we currently still use modification of X in "MoveMe" in players.cpp. Should be removed from MoveMe and 
placed into the keyhandler function, using vX modification instead (will give us inertia when jumping).
=>This is not a finished merge!

- Added -fPIC to the new Makefile (thanks Judo). (DARKGuy)
- Removed the makefiles and unified them into one, they also must have the include path of GP2D, according to Doddi's makefiles so iteam uses those instead of having a local copy on /library_h. The local copy is still needed though. (DARKGuy)
- Modified TODO.

- Forgot to add all of the changes so I'm gonna list the most important ones... (DARKGuy)
  - Adapted the code to use GP2D's new sprite/spritesheet implemented class by doddi. (DARKGuy)
  - The countdown timer is broken now, it has to be fixed because it now shows only the first sprite ("3"). (DARKGuy)
  - Removed the binary files. You'll have to compile the game before running it now.

- First changelog file... huh, I should've added one long time ago... well, here it is. (DARKGuy)
- Removed a few files that aren't gonna be used anymore (Iceworld folder, libgp2d.so in Library_h, mage.png from the characters and Song8.mp3 from the music). (DARKGuy)
